# R code

The R code in `ScrapePoo.R`: 
(1) Scrapes the data; 
(2) Logs it;
(3) Plots it, and; 
(4) Composes text for tweet.

`GetBeachStatus.R` scrapes indiviual sampling location websites for water status ("Open" or "Posted). Currently lists beaches from south to north: Sloat (Ocean Beach) to Crissy Field East (Inside the mouth of SF Bay).

Tweets are sent via the `TweetShit.R` code.
